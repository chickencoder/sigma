## What is Sigma?

Sigma is a micro-trading game written to explore how stock markets work.
The exchange protocols and features are very limited and perhaps not
entirely realistic.

### Sigma CLI
Currently, the primary interface for interacting with the exchange is
through the command line. You can register, trade and manage your assets
entirely from the comfort of your own terminal.

##### Register for a trading account
```bash
$ sigma register
```

##### Login to your account
```bash
$ sigma login
```

##### View your current portfolio
```bash
$ sigma portfolio
```
